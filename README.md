# Loop-TNR_rg
These are demo codes that is related to my paper below.

[Physical Review B 104 (16), 165132](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11460), [Physical Review E 106 (1), 014104](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07042), and [Phys. Rev. B 108, 024413](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06632).

The original descriptions of Loop-TNR can be found in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 110504](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04938).
 
The validity of my cades are not guaranteed. You may try other models by changing the initial tensors in "Initialization.py".

You might need to pip install sympy and ncon.
